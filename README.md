<h1>ICEWRECKER</h1>
<h2>Introduction<h2>
<p>
  A horror game made in Unity3D game engine.
  The game was made as modular as possible, so the majority of components could be reused.
  This game was made with the sole intent of showing my skills in game programming, modelling and animating
  The game is totally free and the source code can be freely analized in this repository 
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
Almost all things were made by me, except:
<ul>
  <li>Monster model [Hugo De Groote](https://hugodg.itch.io/)</li>
  <li>Monster animations [Hugo De Groote](https://hugodg.itch.io/)</li>
  <li>My logo at the beginning of the game [NIJI](https://www.instagram.com/niji_ewe/)</li>
  <li>Almost all audio sources</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Story & Location</h2>
<p>
The game is located on a ship named "Icewrecker", in the middle of the Ross Sea. 
For an unkown reason you are stuck on this ship without a single human and must try to leave the vassel.. unharmed.
</p>

<h2>Scripting</h2>
<p>
As said before all the components were made with the intent of reusability, such as the __d-pad update system__, __interact system__ and __audio system__
Most important components have been fully commented and explained in their functionality. I know this is just standard practice but when i started this project
didn't used to comment functions and rapidly regretted it.
<h3>Monster AI</h3>
The monster has some basic and advanced behavior. Its AI works as follows
